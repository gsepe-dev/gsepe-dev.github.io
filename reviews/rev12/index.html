                            <p>The Snowman, directed by Dianne Jackson and based on Raymond Briggs&rsquo; illustrated book, is an animated short film that, despite its brevity, leaves a lasting impression on viewers. The story is simple: a child builds a snowman, which comes to life during the night. From that moment on, a friendship is born that leads them on an extraordinary adventure, culminating in the famous flight over snow-covered landscapes and illuminated cities, accompanied by the famous song ‘Walking in the Air’. It is a story that needs no words, because everything is conveyed through images and music, creating a universal language that speaks directly to the emotions.</p>
<p>Watching the film, what strikes you is its suspended, almost fragile atmosphere. The animation, created with crayons and coloured pencils, has a soft and dreamy look, making each scene resemble a childhood memory. It is not a perfect or glossy animation, but it is precisely this imperfection that makes it authentic, as if it were a dream taking shape before your eyes. The flight sequence is perhaps the most memorable moment: the child and the puppet rise from the ground and travel across snowy landscapes, seas and cities on a journey that seems endless. It is a scene that conveys freedom, wonder and a sense of pure magic, as if for a moment it were possible to detach oneself from reality and live in a world where anything is possible.</p>
<p><img src="/reviews/rev12/img01.jpg" alt="img01"></p>
<p>Personally, I find that the film manages to evoke not only the joy of childhood, but also its melancholy. The ending, in which the child discovers that the snowman has melted with the return of the sun, is a bittersweet epilogue that leaves a sense of emptiness. It is an image that speaks of the fleeting nature of beautiful things, of their inevitable end, but also of their importance. Despite the loss, the memory of the adventure remains, and that memory becomes a treasure to be cherished. It is a lesson that goes beyond Christmas and childhood: it reminds us that every special moment is destined to fade away, but that is precisely why it should be lived intensely.</p>
<p>What strikes me every time I watch “The Snowman” is its ability to take me back in time. No matter how many years have passed, the film manages to reawaken the same sense of wonder you feel as a child when you look out of the window and see the snow falling. It is a work that invites you to slow down, to let yourself be carried away by the images and music, without the need for explanations or words. In a world accustomed to complex stories and spectacular special effects, the simplicity of ‘The Snowman’ becomes its strength. A small visual poem that celebrates imagination, friendship and the fleeting beauty of life.</p>
<p>Watching it today, beyond the Christmas context, also means reflecting on how important it is to keep alive our capacity for wonder. The snowman that comes to life is a metaphor for the magic we can find in the simplest things, if we are willing to look at them with curious eyes. It is a film that invites us not to forget the child we once were, and to carry that sense of wonder with us into adulthood. Perhaps this is precisely why it continues to move us; after all, it reminds us that true magic lies not in gifts or lights, but in the ability to experience and share moments that, although destined to fade, remain indelible in our hearts.</p>
