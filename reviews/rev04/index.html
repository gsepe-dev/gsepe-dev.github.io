                            <p>What does it mean to see beyond the smoke from the chimneys?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poupelle of the City of Chimneys&rdquo; invites us to reflect on this and much more in a way that is as magical as it is moving.</p>
<p>Directed by Yūsuke Hirota and released in 2020, today we are discussing a Japanese film that presents itself as a modern fairy tale ready to enchant viewers with its fantastical setting and touching story of friendship, courage, and hope.</p>
<p>The story unfolds in the peculiar Chimney Town, a city completely oppressed by smoke from chimneys, where the sky is a distant memory and the stars are considered only a legend. In this grey and suffocating context, the protagonist, Lubicchi, a boy with a kind soul and an extraordinary curiosity, moves around. His life changes radically when he meets Poupelle, a magical creature made of rubbish, but with a heart and humanity that are surprising when compared to the inhabitants of the city. Together, they face difficulties, mistrust and prejudice, pushing beyond the boundaries of what is possible to try to prove that, beyond the smoke, the stars really do exist.</p>

<p>What immediately strikes the viewer are the details in the visual realisation of the backgrounds and sequences. Although this was the first film produced entirely in 3DCG by Studio 4°C, each scene is so distinctive that it looks like a painting, with vivid colours and details that almost seem to come to life. Obviously, not all the technical aspects of the film are sublime, as the characters&rsquo; movements, perhaps due to the animation team&rsquo;s inexperience in using new tools, are simple, but this does not negatively impact the film&rsquo;s enjoyment. In fact, the animation also manages to capture the emotional atmosphere of the story, moving from moments of moving intimacy to sequences of epic adventure. The soundtrack deserves a special mention: the music not only accompanies the narrative but also amplifies the emotions, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer.</p>
<p><img src="/reviews/rev04/img02.jpg" alt="img02"></p>
<p>From a narrative point of view, the film shines for its ability to convey universal messages that touch everyone&rsquo;s heart. The story of Lubicchi and Poupelle becomes a powerful metaphor for the importance of believing in your dreams and not giving up in the face of adversity. In a world that often seems full of obstacles and limitations, the film reminds us that it is only by overcoming barriers, real or imagined, that we can reach for the stars.</p>
<p>Despite the beautiful message behind it, there are some critical issues to be found while watching. For example, at certain points, the pace of the narrative seems uneven, shifting from moments that appear a little rushed to others that are excessively drawn out. Furthermore, although the bond between Lubicchi and Poupelle is well developed, some secondary characters could have been given more space to further enrich the plot, as they seem to have been introduced only to be used in the finale. Nevertheless, these imperfections do not detract from the overall value of the work.</p>
<p><img src="/reviews/rev04/img03.jpg" alt="img03"></p>
<p>From a personal point of view, the film left a good impression on me. I felt inspired by Lubicchi&rsquo;s courage and his determination not to let himself be defeated by the limitations imposed by society. Furthermore, his friendship with Poupelle reminded me of the importance of embracing diversity and finding beauty even where
it seems to be absent. This message struck me, considering our current world, where we often tend to judge or ignore what we do not understand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ‘Poupelle of the City of Chimneys’ is not just a story, but a little reminder of hope, inviting us to look up and search for the stars where we least expect them.</p>
