      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But even if you think you know someone well, even if you love that person deeply, you cannot see completely into their heart. You will only feel hurt. But if you try hard enough, you should be able to see quite well into your own heart. So, in the end, what we should do is be honest with our hearts and accept them in a mature way. If you really want to see someone, the only option is to look at yourself directly and deeply.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LIZ AND THE BLUE BIRD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird is a 2018 film produced by Kyoto Animation and directed by Naoko Yamada (probably best known to most audiences for her work on the film The Voices of a Distant Bird), focusing on the relationship between Mizore and Nozomi, two close friends who are members of a high school music club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the film is only a spin-off from the world of ‘Sound! Euphonium’, it is not necessary to have seen the series to understand the general context and fully enjoy the story. The introductory part, in fact, focuses exclusively on Mizore, a reserved and quiet girl who waits silently for her friend Nozomi (the perfect embodiment of the stereotype of the lively and popular girl among students) on the steps of their school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Snowman, directed by Dianne Jackson and based on Raymond Briggs&amp;rsquo; illustrated book, is an animated short film that, despite its brevity, leaves a lasting impression on viewers. The story is simple: a child builds a snowman, which comes to life during the night. From that moment on, a friendship is born that leads them on an extraordinary adventure, culminating in the famous flight over snow-covered landscapes and illuminated cities, accompanied by the famous song ‘Walking in the Air’. It is a story that needs no words, because everything is conveyed through images and music, creating a universal language that speaks directly to the emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, please be advised that the following content may be seriously harmful to you if you have particular tastes, often justified with phrases such as &amp;lsquo;How can it be bad if it has made so much money??“ or &amp;lsquo;Tastes are subjective!”. so as a precaution, I recommend turning the page and relaxing with a new RAI series to return to your comfort zone. If, on the other hand, you consider yourself intrepid or crazy enough to want to continue, I welcome you to this new review, because what we are going to talk about is truly out of the ordinary and deserves to be told with care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a melody that vibrates beneath the surface of life, imperceptible but constant, made up of moments, emotions and silences. Soul attempts to capture it, to give it form and sound, through a narrative that intertwines jazz notes and otherworldly visions, philosophy and animation, lightness and depth. It is a film that is not content with simply telling a story, but seeks to explore the very meaning of existence, asking questions that we often avoid, but which have always tormented us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ARETE HIME</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that don&amp;rsquo;t shout, don&amp;rsquo;t impose themselves, don&amp;rsquo;t try to please everyone. Princess Arete is one of them. Directed by Sunao Katabuchi and produced by Studio 4°C in 2001, it is a work that has chosen silence, slowness and depth. And for this reason, perhaps, it has never received the appreciation it deserves. But today, thanks to its free (albeit temporary) viewing on YouTube, we have a rare opportunity to rediscover it. And we should do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that manage to bend a myth without breaking it, to reinvent an archetype without dissipating its original magic. &amp;lsquo;Cinderella The Cat&amp;rsquo; belongs to this select circle: a fairy tale tinged with the shadows of crime news, touching on the sharp edges of noir and delving into the pulsating and contradictory heart of Naples.&#xA;No royal balls or golden pumpkins: Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone&amp;rsquo;s Cinderella wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and corridors of the city&amp;rsquo;s underground. No royal balls or golden pumpkins: the Cinderella of Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and metal corridors inside the Megaride, a ship-world stranded in the harbour like a sleeping giant. That rusty steel is the funeral monument to a promise of progress never kept, the emblem of a bright future trapped in the meshes of corruption and abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had told you that the same studio behind ‘The Emoji Movie’ would produce a film about a K-pop band that defeats demons with music, you would probably have burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet &amp;lsquo;Kpop Demon Hunters&amp;rsquo;, released on Netflix in June 2025, has managed to establish itself as one of the platform&amp;rsquo;s most viewed titles, creating a surprisingly active and passionate community around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cinema is the most direct way to compete with God.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without meaning to, Fellini managed to sum up what this film is all about in a single sentence. The dream of an aspiring director turns into a passionate ode to the seventh art, told with the heart of someone who loves it deeply and the mind of someone who knows how to question it. Between surreal comedy and a structure that manages to alternate between comedy and drama, the viewer finds themselves immersed in a meta-cinematic film that shows the process of making a film, starting from dreams and ending with the birth of the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What colour are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a simple question, yet it encompasses a sea of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Colorful&amp;rsquo;, the animated film directed by Keiichi Hara (based on the novel by Eto Mori) and released in 2010, takes us on a delicate and profound journey on the theme of rebirth and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story begins in a rather unusual way: the viewer is enveloped in dark colours and the setting resembles a railway ticket office. Amidst this chaos, voice-over narration introduces us to the thoughts of a lost soul, disoriented and without identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to see beyond the smoke from the chimneys?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Poupelle of the City of Chimneys&amp;rdquo; invites us to reflect on this and much more in a way that is as magical as it is moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Directed by Yūsuke Hirota and released in 2020, today we are discussing a Japanese film that presents itself as a modern fairy tale ready to enchant viewers with its fantastical setting and touching story of friendship, courage, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to love stories that defy convention, &amp;lsquo;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&amp;rsquo; stands out as a film that is truly one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Directed by Michel Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman, this 2004 masterpiece explores the complexities of human relationships through non-linear storytelling and a unique combination of emotions and philosophical reflections. Halfway between romantic drama and science fiction, the film tackles the themes of memory, regret and emotional resilience, offering the audience an intense and engaging experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Brutalist&amp;rsquo; is Brady Corbet&amp;rsquo;s new film starring Adrien Brody, a duo that certainly needs no introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This film is monumental in every respect, so much so that it seems like a blockbuster. The fact that it cost &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; ten million and was shot in a month makes it even more impressive, despite the fact that the Italian dubbing does not do it justice as well as the original version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Once she arrives in a rather &amp;ldquo;unusual&amp;rdquo; town, the girl meets a boy who wanders silently. From that moment on, the stories of the two characters intertwine and they keep each other company for the rest of the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Una volta arrivata in una città piuttosto “particolare”, la bambina incontra un ragazzo che vaga silenziosamente. Da quel momento in poi, le storie dei due personaggi si intrecciano e si fanno compagnia per tutto il resto del film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, there has been increasing discussion about artificial intelligence, how it can revolutionise our lives, and what the future holds&amp;hellip; even though the only innovation for the end user seems to be a new feature added to various products solely to increase sales.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are also companies on the market such as Red Hat, a leader in the field of reliable open source solutions, which, despite some ethical stumbles since it was acquired by IBM, always strives to innovate and find real applications for new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
