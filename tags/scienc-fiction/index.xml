      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tenshi no tamago&amp;rsquo; is a 1985 Japanese animated film directed by Mamoru Oshii (also known for the famous &amp;lsquo;Ghost in the Shell&amp;rsquo;) which, since its theatrical release, has managed to surprise all viewers with its style reminiscent of a constantly moving pictorial fresco.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot centres on a mysterious little girl who carries a large egg with her as she travels through a post-apocalyptic world. Once she arrives in a rather &amp;ldquo;unusual&amp;rdquo; town, the girl meets a boy who wanders silently. From that moment on, the stories of the two characters intertwine and they keep each other company for the rest of the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
