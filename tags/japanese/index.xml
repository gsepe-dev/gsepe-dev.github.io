      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But even if you think you know someone well, even if you love that person deeply, you cannot see completely into their heart. You will only feel hurt. But if you try hard enough, you should be able to see quite well into your own heart. So, in the end, what we should do is be honest with our hearts and accept them in a mature way. If you really want to see someone, the only option is to look at yourself directly and deeply.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
