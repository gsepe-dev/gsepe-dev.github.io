      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird is a 2018 film produced by Kyoto Animation and directed by Naoko Yamada (probably best known to most audiences for her work on the film The Voices of a Distant Bird), focusing on the relationship between Mizore and Nozomi, two close friends who are members of a high school music club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the film is only a spin-off from the world of ‘Sound! Euphonium’, it is not necessary to have seen the series to understand the general context and fully enjoy the story. The introductory part, in fact, focuses exclusively on Mizore, a reserved and quiet girl who waits silently for her friend Nozomi (the perfect embodiment of the stereotype of the lively and popular girl among students) on the steps of their school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had told you that the same studio behind ‘The Emoji Movie’ would produce a film about a K-pop band that defeats demons with music, you would probably have burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet &amp;lsquo;Kpop Demon Hunters&amp;rsquo;, released on Netflix in June 2025, has managed to establish itself as one of the platform&amp;rsquo;s most viewed titles, creating a surprisingly active and passionate community around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
