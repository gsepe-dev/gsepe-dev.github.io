      <title>SOUL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a melody that vibrates beneath the surface of life, imperceptible but constant, made up of moments, emotions and silences. Soul attempts to capture it, to give it form and sound, through a narrative that intertwines jazz notes and otherworldly visions, philosophy and animation, lightness and depth. It is a film that is not content with simply telling a story, but seeks to explore the very meaning of existence, asking questions that we often avoid, but which have always tormented us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ARETE HIME</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that don&amp;rsquo;t shout, don&amp;rsquo;t impose themselves, don&amp;rsquo;t try to please everyone. Princess Arete is one of them. Directed by Sunao Katabuchi and produced by Studio 4°C in 2001, it is a work that has chosen silence, slowness and depth. And for this reason, perhaps, it has never received the appreciation it deserves. But today, thanks to its free (albeit temporary) viewing on YouTube, we have a rare opportunity to rediscover it. And we should do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CINDERELLA THE CAT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that manage to bend a myth without breaking it, to reinvent an archetype without dissipating its original magic. &amp;lsquo;Cinderella The Cat&amp;rsquo; belongs to this select circle: a fairy tale tinged with the shadows of crime news, touching on the sharp edges of noir and delving into the pulsating and contradictory heart of Naples.&#xA;No royal balls or golden pumpkins: Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone&amp;rsquo;s Cinderella wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and corridors of the city&amp;rsquo;s underground. No royal balls or golden pumpkins: the Cinderella of Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and metal corridors inside the Megaride, a ship-world stranded in the harbour like a sleeping giant. That rusty steel is the funeral monument to a promise of progress never kept, the emblem of a bright future trapped in the meshes of corruption and abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>POMPO: THE CINÉPHILE</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/reviews/rev06/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cinema is the most direct way to compete with God.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without meaning to, Fellini managed to sum up what this film is all about in a single sentence. The dream of an aspiring director turns into a passionate ode to the seventh art, told with the heart of someone who loves it deeply and the mind of someone who knows how to question it. Between surreal comedy and a structure that manages to alternate between comedy and drama, the viewer finds themselves immersed in a meta-cinematic film that shows the process of making a film, starting from dreams and ending with the birth of the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COLORFUL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What colour are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a simple question, yet it encompasses a sea of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Colorful&amp;rsquo;, the animated film directed by Keiichi Hara (based on the novel by Eto Mori) and released in 2010, takes us on a delicate and profound journey on the theme of rebirth and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story begins in a rather unusual way: the viewer is enveloped in dark colours and the setting resembles a railway ticket office. Amidst this chaos, voice-over narration introduces us to the thoughts of a lost soul, disoriented and without identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to love stories that defy convention, &amp;lsquo;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&amp;rsquo; stands out as a film that is truly one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Directed by Michel Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman, this 2004 masterpiece explores the complexities of human relationships through non-linear storytelling and a unique combination of emotions and philosophical reflections.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tenshi no tamago&amp;rsquo; is a 1985 Japanese animated film directed by Mamoru Oshii (also known for the famous &amp;lsquo;Ghost in the Shell&amp;rsquo;) which, since its theatrical release, has managed to surprise all viewers with its style reminiscent of a constantly moving pictorial fresco.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot centres on a mysterious little girl who carries a large egg with her as she travels through a post-apocalyptic world. Once she arrives in a rather &amp;ldquo;unusual&amp;rdquo; town, the girl meets a boy who wanders silently. From that moment on, the stories of the two characters intertwine and they keep each other company for the rest of the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
