      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a melody that vibrates beneath the surface of life, imperceptible but constant, made up of moments, emotions and silences. Soul attempts to capture it, to give it form and sound, through a narrative that intertwines jazz notes and otherworldly visions, philosophy and animation, lightness and depth. It is a film that is not content with simply telling a story, but seeks to explore the very meaning of existence, asking questions that we often avoid, but which have always tormented us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that manage to bend a myth without breaking it, to reinvent an archetype without dissipating its original magic. &amp;lsquo;Cinderella The Cat&amp;rsquo; belongs to this select circle: a fairy tale tinged with the shadows of crime news, touching on the sharp edges of noir and delving into the pulsating and contradictory heart of Naples.&#xA;No royal balls or golden pumpkins: Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone&amp;rsquo;s Cinderella wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and corridors of the city&amp;rsquo;s underground. No royal balls or golden pumpkins: the Cinderella of Alessandro Rak, Ivan Cappiello, Marino Guarnieri and Dario Sansone wanders barefoot among corroded walkways and metal corridors inside the Megaride, a ship-world stranded in the harbour like a sleeping giant. That rusty steel is the funeral monument to a promise of progress never kept, the emblem of a bright future trapped in the meshes of corruption and abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
