      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, please be advised that the following content may be seriously harmful to you if you have particular tastes, often justified with phrases such as &amp;lsquo;How can it be bad if it has made so much money??“ or &amp;lsquo;Tastes are subjective!”. so as a precaution, I recommend turning the page and relaxing with a new RAI series to return to your comfort zone. If, on the other hand, you consider yourself intrepid or crazy enough to want to continue, I welcome you to this new review, because what we are going to talk about is truly out of the ordinary and deserves to be told with care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ARETE HIME</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are films that don&amp;rsquo;t shout, don&amp;rsquo;t impose themselves, don&amp;rsquo;t try to please everyone. Princess Arete is one of them. Directed by Sunao Katabuchi and produced by Studio 4°C in 2001, it is a work that has chosen silence, slowness and depth. And for this reason, perhaps, it has never received the appreciation it deserves. But today, thanks to its free (albeit temporary) viewing on YouTube, we have a rare opportunity to rediscover it. And we should do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had told you that the same studio behind ‘The Emoji Movie’ would produce a film about a K-pop band that defeats demons with music, you would probably have burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet &amp;lsquo;Kpop Demon Hunters&amp;rsquo;, released on Netflix in June 2025, has managed to establish itself as one of the platform&amp;rsquo;s most viewed titles, creating a surprisingly active and passionate community around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COLORFUL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What colour are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a simple question, yet it encompasses a sea of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Colorful&amp;rsquo;, the animated film directed by Keiichi Hara (based on the novel by Eto Mori) and released in 2010, takes us on a delicate and profound journey on the theme of rebirth and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story begins in a rather unusual way: the viewer is enveloped in dark colours and the setting resembles a railway ticket office. Amidst this chaos, voice-over narration introduces us to the thoughts of a lost soul, disoriented and without identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TENSHI NO TAMAGO</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tenshi no tamago&amp;rsquo; is a 1985 Japanese animated film directed by Mamoru Oshii (also known for the famous &amp;lsquo;Ghost in the Shell&amp;rsquo;) which, since its theatrical release, has managed to surprise all viewers with its style reminiscent of a constantly moving pictorial fresco.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot centres on a mysterious little girl who carries a large egg with her as she travels through a post-apocalyptic world. Once she arrives in a rather &amp;ldquo;unusual&amp;rdquo; town, the girl meets a boy who wanders silently. From that moment on, the stories of the two characters intertwine and they keep each other company for the rest of the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
